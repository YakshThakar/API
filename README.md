Face Recognition API For Windows user who can Easily Do face detection & Recogition.
Goto Command Prompt: Type "pip install face_recognition" after that Go to Environment variable and set path Ex. C:/Python36/site-packages/face recognition
for better Experiance you should use Python 3+. all those stuff must require in face recognition package.
if it does not work then goto download page:-https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition.
in which you should update face_recognition folder with  folder name "face recognition" that I updated in my API field which is actually for windows.
That works on tolerance level 0.7.
